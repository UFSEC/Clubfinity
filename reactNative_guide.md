# ‚õ≥ Ramping Up with React Native ‚õ≥

‚ùó Before you start this make sure you've gone through a basic React Native course and have some understanding of the absolute basics! Also you should know how to run the app on your phone via expo (if not, details are on the Readme.md) This guide is meant to help you *practice* the stuff you learned. If you're unsure about where you stand I highly recommend the official React Native tutotrial [link here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial) It is interactive and you can tinker around with code directly in browser without any setup.

### Creating an Awesome Component üë∂
To start off we've created a special branch on our repo so you can complete these excersices easily. On your local machine go to the directory where you have cloned this repo. for eg. `C:/Users/blanch/Desktop/clubfinity` and then `cd` into the /clubfinity folder. 

Now fetch a new branch from the remote repo and switch over to it via:
* `git fetch origin react_onramp`
* `git checkout react_onramp`

Open the project in your preferred code editor and navigate to the new component file `/Frontend/components/SimpleComponent.js` You'll find some boilerplate code there already setup with comments describing their function briefly. Try running the app via `expo start` on your phone you should see the Home page is replaced by this:

###### üí† Your first task is to convert this Simple component into an Awesome Component! Here's a wireframe of what this component should look like this:

Your component structure should look like the provided wireframe (note the positions of each subcomponent), but you can go crazy on the colors or image etc! :D The task requirements are as follows:
* [ ] Create an empty View and display it on the screen (might need border/bg color to be able to discern it)
* [ ] Add 2 Text Views
* [ ] Add an Image view. It can be any image you want but keep it SFW please :eyes:
* [ ] Use Flexbox to style and shape your component

If you have problems or issues during this exercise or any others feel free to post on the #clubfinity-project channel on our Slack! Once you've completed the above tasks you're welcome to take a screenshot of your Awesome component on the channel too :)

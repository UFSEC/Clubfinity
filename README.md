#### The Premise

A vital part of campus life :school: for any student is exploring diverse communities 🙌 that share their interests 🦸 and help them feel empowered :muscle: during their college life. 

With a campus as huge as UF 🐊 there are multiple clubs and societies to join, but there is a wide communication 📢 gap between interested students and the organizations causing general students to be unaware 🤷🏽 of ongoing events, and the clubs to resort to harrasing passerbys in Turlington 😤 ‍ 

###### Ok so where does clubfinity come in?
Clubfinity aims to fill this vacuum between students and clubs via providing a spectacular platform where you can:

- Follow your favorite clubs and be notified of upcoming events or announcements
- Easily discover new groups of interest
- Enjoy reduced turlington tablers (It's not going away completely 🙃)
- Effectively manage your own student clubs

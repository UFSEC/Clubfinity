Here's a list of tutorials, videos etc to help you get started with the tools and frameworks we'll be using throughout this project lifecycle. If you're a complete beginner to programming we highly recommend getting familiar with git, agile and javascript. If you're comfortable with fundamental programming concepts then you can skip ahead to React Native (if you're interested in developing the mobile app portion i.e. the frontend) OR if you're more interested in working on servers and API logic then you can start with Node.js + Express.js (the backend of our app).
